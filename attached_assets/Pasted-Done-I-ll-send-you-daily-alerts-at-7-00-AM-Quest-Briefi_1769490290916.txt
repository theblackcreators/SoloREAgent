SOLO LEVELING: HOUSTON AGENT — 12-Month “Rise From E-Rank” Program

You’re starting with nothing but this guide. Your job is to level up your body + your name + your income in the Greater Houston “open world.”

Your HUD (Stats + Ranks)

Stats (0–100):
	•	STR (Strength) — lifting/calisthenics progress
	•	STA (Stamina) — steps/cardio consistency
	•	AGI (Agility) — mobility, pace, recovery
	•	INT (Knowledge) — contracts, scripts, market intel
	•	CHA (Charisma) — conversations, follow-ups, confidence
	•	REP (Reputation) — reviews, referrals, local presence
	•	GOLD (Income) — commissions + side income + savings buffer

Agent Ranks (based on weekly score):
	•	E (0–99) → D (100–199) → C (200–299) → B (300–399) → A (400–499) → S (500+)

Weekly Score (simple):
	•	Fitness completions (max 70) + Business outputs (max 350) + Learning (max 80) = 500 possible

⸻

The Rule of the System

	1.	Move: 30–60 minutes total activity (walk + short workout)
	2.	Hunt: 1–2 hours of lead generation + follow-up
	3.	Learn: 20 minutes skill study
	4.	Log: update tracker (takes 3 minutes)
